        <p>The core tension in Neonexus is the battle between full digital immersion and reclaiming raw reality... If the Neonites succeed, reality will vanish entirely under layers of data. If the Untethered
            triumph, they could destabilize essential tech systems, plunging parts of the city into chaotic
            darkness.</p>

        <p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Worship technological advancement... Neonites view Data Shades as remnants of the old world and hold
            “cleansing” rituals to purge lingering data from their devices, seeing them as
            purifiers.</p>
        <p><strong>Customs:</strong> Weekly gatherings, known as “The Flicker,” take place, where
            Neonites share device updates and virtual avatars as a way to enhance
            community bonds....</p>

        <p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> Oppose AR immersion, valuing tactile reality... They view Neonites with suspicion, often engaging in subtle acts of
            rebellion by blocking signals or sabotaging virtual layers.</p>
        <p><strong>Customs:</strong> Host “Bare Moments” gatherings... “Bare Moments” gatherings, where they disconnect and experience
            the physical world together. They also keep hidden maps of non-digital zones.</p>
