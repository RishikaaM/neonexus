        <p><strong>Name of the World:</strong> Neonexus</p>
        <p>Neonexus is an expansive, tiered city stretching vertically more than horizontally. The lower
            layers are dense with towering skyscrapers interconnected by skybridges, creating a labyrinth of
            streets and alleys. Higher levels are accessible only to certain social classes or those with
            clearance, where the atmosphere is slightly clearer and sunlight occasionally filters through the
            artificial lights. At the base lies a network of old infrastructure where remnants of nature cling,
            but in higher levels, the city is washed in a sea of holographic lights and illuminated digital
            displays.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Centuries ago, the Earthâ€™s atmosphere was heavily polluted, blocking natural light and leading to
            what is now called the Perpetual Twilight. Neonexus was built in response to the growing need
            for hyper-connected, self-sustaining environments. Its layered construction was a social
            experiment to handle overpopulation and optimize technological advancements, but it also
            created a hierarchy where access to technology and resources became the new social divide.</p>
